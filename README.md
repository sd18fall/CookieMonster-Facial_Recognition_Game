# Cookie Monster

This project uses OpenCV and PyGame to create a fun, interactive game. 

This game works by using facial recognition to find the player's mouth. The player must then use their mouth to collect cookies in the game.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The following libraries must be installed on your computer for this game to work:

```
PyGame
OpenCV
```

### Installing

To install these libraries do the following:

```
pip install pygame
```

And repeat

```
pip install opencv-python
```


## Running the program

Run the program by going to the folder and using the following command

```
python3 cookiemonster.py
```

### How to know if the program works and debugging

A window should open with an avatar and cookies falling from the screen. When you move your face the avatar should move too. If you run into issues with the avatar not following your face make sure:

```
- You have no face coverings like a hat or doctor's mask
- Your camera is on or you have a camera connected to your computer
- You are looking straight at the camera
```
