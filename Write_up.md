Project Overview [Maximum 100 words]

Cookie Monster uses facial recognition ot track your face as a controller for a video game. Cookies fall from the screen and you try to catch them in your cookie monster's mouth by moving your own face around. Falling bombs complicate this.

Results [~2-3 paragraphs + figures/examples]

We made a super fun game! Its challenging and engaging to move around with your actual face because you actually have to dodge bombs in the physical world.

Implementation [~2-3 paragraphs + UML diagram]

Describe your implementation at a system architecture level. Include a UML class diagram, and talk about the major components, algorithms, data structures and how they fit together. You should also discuss at least one design decision where you had to choose between multiple alternatives, and explain why you made the choice you did.


Reflection [~2 paragraphs]

From a process point of view, what went well? What could you improve? Other possible reflection topics: Was your project appropriately scoped? Did you have a good plan for unit testing? How will you use what you learned going forward? What do you wish you knew before you started that would have helped you succeed?

Also discuss your team process in your reflection. How did you plan to divide the work (e.g. split by class, always pair program together, etc.) and how did it actually happen? Were there any issues that arose while working together, and how did you address them? What would you do differently next time?
